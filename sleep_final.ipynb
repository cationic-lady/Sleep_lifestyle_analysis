    "Some limilations of this model:\n",
    "* The model is not trained for people with underwight BMI because of non-data availability.\n",
    "* The model was mainly trained on people with high and normal BP range.\n",
    "* Although the data was unbalanced with most people without any sleep disorders (219 out of 374 to be exact), the model accurately predicts the presence of any sleep disorder in the individual.\n",
    "    * It is to be noted, though, that the model might still misjudge the exact disorder - Sleep Apnea or Insomnia. \n",
    "    * This can be improved with more data or by increasing/obtaining some other features that particularly impact their diagnosis.\n",
    "    * Also, sources suggest there is a little confusion in diagnosis of these disorders irrespective of the involvement of machine learning approaches. \n"
